# The joys of an older, more matured game
So literally the day we got the news that work was shutting it's door to the public I found myself in CEX trading in Blu-Rays, DVDs and a few games. I had my eye on a shiny B-rated FiiO X-5ii Hi Res portable music player. After the transaction and apologies for being part of the problem by actually being in store (to be fair, I was off to work after the purchase) a very well placed Xbox360 shelf caught my eye as I was leaving. Staring straight at me was _Albion_'s favourite hero, fenceforth named ~~me~ _Sparrow_. This sparked an old memory of High-School in Aberdeen, conversing with a friend from the year below (remember when that was taboo?) about our favourite fantasy RPGs. I had just experienced the splendour of _The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion_ (to which will **ALWAYS** be my favourite TES game) and he was advocating _Fable 2_.
