# Quarantine Film Club I
## Pom Poko (Isao Takahata, 1995)

For my entire life I have been a (closeted) weeb. However, I am ashamed to say that my knowledge of _Studio Ghibli_ is not as extensive as I may ever claim. The Japanese animation studio is analogous to an eastern Disney, and as such, I've always wanted to share that first-time experience with someone special. Someone who would appreciate the finer aspects of anime as a genre. Well, when in quarantine, am I right?

Pom Poko is a fantastic, whimsical story about racoons, and their legendary ability to shapeshift. The film explores the issue of aggressive expansion and its impact on local environments utilising a 'mock-umentary' style of narration: building on the likes of '_This is Spinal Tap_' from the 80s.

Full disclaimer, this is actually the third Ghibli film I've watched in the recent present (barring the only film created by the studio I watched as a child: _Kiki's Delivery Service_), with Pom Poko having followed _Porco Rosso_ and _Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind_. Needless to say, I adored both, however I had bigged-up _Nausicaa_ slightly too much in my head, resulting in a somewhat disappointing reception on my part.

Of course, I haven't been watching these films in chronological order, but _Pom Poko_'s departure from what I could describe as the studio's traditional style of narration really captured my imagination and sucked me into the movie.

As well as dealing with the theme of environmental implications of human expansion, _Pom Poko_ portrays the struggles of age-ism, and offers a balanced argument for and against both the young, hot-headed racoons, and the older, wiser, more patient members of the clan.

All in all, this film has truly captured my heart, offering a fully-fledged story (unlike the open-ended _Porco Rosso_ and _Nausicaa_) with some beautiful cinematography, and that quintessential Ghibli sound design and scoring. Spend a short hour-and-a-bit and just watch it. It's funny, heart-warming, and a great introduction to the world of Studio Ghibli.
