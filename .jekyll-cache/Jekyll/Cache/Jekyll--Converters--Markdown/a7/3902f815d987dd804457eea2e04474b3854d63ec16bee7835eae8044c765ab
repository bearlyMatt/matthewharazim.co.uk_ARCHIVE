<p>So to start off, I want to make it very clear: I’ve had a lot of free time with the delightful social distancing from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) and decided to mess around with WSL, Raspberry Pi and the internet.

My biggest trouble was actually hosting Jekyll on my Apache server, but I’m getting ahead of myself (more on that later).</p>
